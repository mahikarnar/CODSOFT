# UI/UX Design Internship – CodSoft

Welcome to the repository containing all my completed tasks for the **UI/UX Design Internship** at **CodSoft**. This experience allowed me to apply core design principles using **Figma**, enhancing my capabilities in wireframing, prototyping, and crafting clean, user-centered interfaces.
